# python_tuto_400_oop

This is same application as python_tuto_400 but using oop (object orientated programming) to achieve the same thing or almost the same thing. There a few minor changes.

Before getting into this version, I tried a version the use 2 files, one with the main module and one with the functions needed inside the module. I was looking for a more modular way to write python scripts.

It's because, it's boring to have to declare and define functions before using. I think it disrupt the logic of the code and make it more difficult to understand.

I was comparing having the functions in a file and using oop. I decided going fully into oop in a simple way because I don't think all the oop concepts for this app and me to learn it would take a long time.

Basic oop, using tkinter and sqlite, functions are declared in a place outside the logic and I think I'll implement this again because I find it practical and not too difficult.

However, something I would need to understand is how to avoid using try/except and pass a variable to a class function member from another function.
